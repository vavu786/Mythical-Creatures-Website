    <h1>Chupacabra</h1>
    <p>
        Chupacabra is a wolf-like creature. Some people think that it had evolved from the extinct Saber Tooth Tiger. Many
        researchers and scientists that don’t believe in mythical creatures, say that the Chupacabra is just a poor, old
        wolf that had a terrible disease, causing it to lose all of it’s hair. Though this may sound true, it is not. The
        Chupacabra loves dark, cramped places, specifically cluttered basements. However, it can also live in the woods,
        its natural habitat. One night, there was a family of two, consisting of an elderly husband and wife. They wanted
        to go camping in a trailer house for a few days in the woods. When they were there, the wife thought that she heard
        a growling noise, but didn't think anything of it at the time. The elderly couple went to sleep in the trailer
        home, and heard something outside again. They decided to go out and see what it was. They saw a silhouette of a
        wolf, but when it came closer, they saw two sharp fangs and bright yellow eyes. The couple ran away as fast as they
        could, jumped in their car, and drove away. They later reported it, claiming that it was the legendary Chupacabra.
