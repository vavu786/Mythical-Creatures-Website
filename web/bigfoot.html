    <h1>BigFoot</h1>
    <p>
        Bigfoot is a large, ape-like creature that lives in the forests of North America. He is extremely hairy and
        has two legs, like a human. Bigfoot is mainly known for his enormous feet. He is about double the size of a
        grizzly bear and is six to nine feet tall. When people visit a forest, and they see enormous footprints
        embedded into the ground, different people will think different things. But an intelligent observer will know
        that it is Bigfoot. They would reason that the footprints are far too big to be a bear or any other wild animal.

        <br> The Bigfoot craze began in the late 1950s
    </h3>
    <p>
        A trail of oversized prints was found in Northern California in 1958. <br> 
        In 1967, Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin released footage of Bigfoot, the first ever found.<br>
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191831/">The film even has an IMBD page.</a>
        <br>The original footprints were revealed in 2002 as fabricated by a logger in the area.

    <h4>
        There was also rumors that the FBI was involved
    </h4>
    <p>
        The assistant director of the FBI's scientific and technical services division, Jay Cochran, Jr., responded to a sample of suspected Bigfoot hair.<br>
        The hair was sent by Peter Byrne in 1976.
        He was Director of the Bigfoot Information Center and Exhibition in Oregon.<br>
        The FBI concluded the hair was from deer, not Bigfoot. <br>
