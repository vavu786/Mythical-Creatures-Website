    <h1>Loch Ness Monster</h1>
    <p>
        Loch Ness Monster is a mixture of a serpent and a dinosaur. She is nicknamed “Nessie,” by the Scottish civilians.
        She lurks in the Scotland Highlands, in a very large lake. Some photographers have claimed to see Nessie,
        bobbing her long neck above the surface of the water, but scientists have simply dismissed this theory, stating
        that it was just a log, or a bird getting a drink from the lake. Many Mythical Experts however, were persistent
        to prove to others that the Loch Ness Monster really did exist.
