    <h1>BigFoot</h1>
    <p>
        Bigfoot is a large, ape-like creature that lives in the forests of North America. He is extremely hairy and
        has two legs, like a human. Bigfoot is mainly known for his enormous feet. He is about double the size of a
        grizzly bear and is six to nine feet tall. When people go to visit a forest, and they see enormous footprints
        embedded on the ground, different people will think different things. But an intelligent observer will know
        that it is Bigfoot. They would reason that the footprints are far too big to be a bear or any other wild animal.
